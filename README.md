## Flappy-Bird

It´s nothing big, it´s nothing new or special. Just the good old flappy bird. I couldn´t find any sprites for the pipes, so i painted them usong the canvas tool from javafx. I coded this one in java, the GUI is made in javafx. Even it´s maybe not necessary i decidet to despawn all the pipes that are out of camera. For that i use a stack. So if you want to get the highscore, there wont be any lags.
